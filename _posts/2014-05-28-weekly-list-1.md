1. [10 Articles Every Programmer Must Read](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2014/05/10-articles-every-programmer-must-read.html)

    10 great articles (some of them even pretend to be small books) on different topics that every programmer should know. They tend to give a lot of useful and in-depth information about a particular topic, which otherwise is very hard to discover. Covers such topics as memory, Unicode, floating point arithmetic, networking, object oriented design, time, URL Encoding, String and more
2. [Caching Tutorial for Web Authors and Webmasters](https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/)

    A good tutorial about cache for web developers. Describes types of caches, how cache works, how to control cache and many others.
3. [An Introduction to Garbage Collection Part IIâ€”A Look Under the Hood](http://icu-project.org/docs/papers/cpp_report/an_introduction_to_garbage_collection_part_ii.html)

    Different algorithms of garbage collection described.

    A big list of books and articles in case you need to prepare for the interview. Worth looking at :)

    As maked in the article: Musings on mostly defensive programming styles. A good reading if you are using Erlang.
